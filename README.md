# Enhancing Web Accessibility: A Proposal for Accessible Page Summaries in HTML5

## The Imperative for Inclusive Design

The internet has become an indispensable resource for information, communication, and participation in modern society. It is crucial that the web is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. 

Currently, blind screen reader users face a significant barrier to efficient web browsing. Unlike sighted users who can quickly scan a page to determine its relevance, screen reader users often must navigate through extensive content to understand the page's purpose. This creates an unequal user experience that must be addressed.

## The Case for Accessible Page Summaries

I propose the adoption of **Accessible Page Summaries** as a standard feature within HTML5. These summaries are brief, human-centered descriptions of a web page's content — including key information such as the topic, scope, and content length — specifically designed to provide screen reader users the same rapid assessment capabilities that sighted users and search engines already enjoy.

### Why Not Leverage Existing Meta Descriptions?

While meta descriptions and Open Graph tags offer some summary information, they are mainly aimed at SEO. These descriptions are crafted to maximize click-through rates and often include a wide range of keywords. This makes them less effective for screen reader users seeking concise and relevant information. 

Accessible Page Summaries, however, prioritize clarity, brevity, and directness, addressing the specific needs of blind users.

## Introducing Accessible Page Summaries: A User-Centric Solution

Accessible Page Summaries offer a practical way to bridge the accessibility gap. By providing screen reader users with concise summaries and content length information, they empower users to make informed decisions about which pages to explore, improving their browsing experience.

### Key Features

- **Opt-in by Default**: Screen reader users can choose to access the summary.
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Invisible to sighted users; does not alter web page appearance.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Functions offline without external resources.
- **Integrated Implementation**: Embeds summaries within the page to avoid URL/redirect errors.
- **WCAG 2.1 AAA Compliance**: Adheres to the highest accessibility standards.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses CSS to position the summary off-screen and enable opt-in functionality. Including the CSS in the `<head>` section ensures consistent, offline functionality while maintaining WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance.

## Future Possibilities

The Accessible Page Summaries concept can be expanded to benefit all users. Imagine browser features that display summaries in a sidebar, providing instant insights into any web page — empowering everyone to make informed browsing decisions.

## Call to Action

This project is a starting point. Further development is needed to extend Accessible Page Summaries to other document types like PDFs and ebooks. Talented engineers and accessibility advocates are invited to contribute to this open-source initiative and make the web more inclusive for everyone.

## Recommendation

I urge the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** to consider incorporating Accessible Page Summaries as a requirement within **WCAG guidelines** and as a fundamental element of **HTML5**. By doing so, the web will truly become an accessible and equitable resource for all users.

## Code Examples

### For Typical Web Pages

```html
<!-- Accessible Page Summary CSS - BEGIN -->
<style>
/* Opt-Out (default) */
.ADA-ps { display: none }
/* Opt-In (selectable) */
.Summary-Opt-In:focus + .ADA-ps { display: block }
/* WCAG 2.1 AAA */
.ada-ps-css-01 {
  background: #fff;
  color: #000;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  line-height: 150%;
  margin-left: -3000rem;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 997;
}
</style>
<!-- Accessible Page Summary CSS - END -->

<!-- Accessible Page Summary - BEGIN -->
<section role="complementary" aria-label="Note about usage" class="ada-ps-css-01">
  <h2>To Hear a Brief Summary of This Web Page Including Content Size Click Open. Then use the down arrow.</h2>
  <button aria-pressed="false" value="Open" class="Summary-Opt-In">Open</button>
  <section role="complementary" aria-label="Note about usage" class="ADA-ps">
    <p>Web Page Description.<br>Replace this line with a Description of the Web page that does not duplicate the meta description tag.</p>
    <p>Alt Text Summary.<br>Replace this line with a very brief summation of all images.</p>
    <p>Content Size.<br>Replace this line with the word count or length (short read, long read, video length, etc.). That completes the Summary. The Web page content starts now.</p>
